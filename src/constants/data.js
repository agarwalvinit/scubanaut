  WHY_SCUBA: "WHY SCUBA DIVE?",
  SCUBA_ANS:
    "DId you know that 70% of the planet is covered with water and over 21,000 species of Ô¨Åsh live in it? Scuba Diving gives you that freedom to explore those unexplored underwater territories and the best part is you don't have to physically exert yourself in the process. A lot of Scuba Divers agree with us that the very act of staying under the water tends to be meditative and relieves stress from our day to day life. Do sign up for our Open Water Diver program to know how this is going to change your life."
